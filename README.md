🏡 Boston House Price Prediction - Full Stack ML Deployment 🚀
This repository contains a full-stack machine learning project that predicts Boston house prices using Flask (Python API), Ionic (Angular 19), and a simple HTML web interface. The project covers everything from training the ML model to deploying it as a web app and even running it on Android! 📱

✨ Features
✅ Machine Learning Model (scikit-learn) trained on the Boston Housing Dataset

✅ Flask API Backend to serve predictions via REST endpoints

✅ Ionic (Angular 19) Mobile App with a user-friendly interface

✅ Standalone HTML/CSS Webpage for quick predictions

✅ Test API using Curl or Postman (curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [0.1, 0.2, 3, 45, 0, 1, 300, 20, 5, 300, 20, 12, 10]}')

✅ Run the app on Android using Capacitor 📱

📂 Tech Stack

🐍 Python (Flask, Scikit-Learn, Joblib) → ML Model & API

⚡ Angular 19 + Ionic → Cross-platform UI

🌎 HTML, CSS, JavaScript → Basic Web Frontend

🎯 How It Works

📊 Train a Linear Regression Model using the Boston Housing dataset

🚀 Deploy the model via Flask API (/predict endpoint)

🌐 Use the Ionic App or HTML page to send data & receive price predictions

📡 Deploy the API & Web App to Render, GitHub Pages, or a Cloud Server
