Fullstack ML Project

Overview

This project is a fullstack machine learning application that integrates Angular, Ionic, Flask, and Linear Regression. The frontend is built using Angular & Ionic, while the backend is developed using Flask. The application allows users to input data, run a Linear Regression model, and visualize the results in an interactive UI.

Tech Stack
